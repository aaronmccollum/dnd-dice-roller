# DnD Dice Rolling Simulator
A dice rolling application which simulates all types of DnD dice and the possible rolls.

## DnD Dice Types
Currently, DnD uses seven dice types in a game, and this application will simulate six of them in version 1.0:
- D20
- D12
- D10
- D8
- D6
- D4

## Languages and Frameworks used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Backlog for future updates:
- Adding a CSS framework
- Add the "percentile dice" as the seventh dice
- Adding ability to roll two dice at once
- Adding dice rolling animation
- Potential to add a JavaScript framework and re-work the application
